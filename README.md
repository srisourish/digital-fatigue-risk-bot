# digital-fatigue-risk-bot
We developed a Digital Wellbeing chatbot that collects user data such as screen time, sleep, physical activity, breaks, and blue light usage. Based on these inputs, it analyzes digital fatigue, provides results and tips, and supports interactive chat using the Ollama AI model with RAG-based dataset querying.
